    "#### What is machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we develop algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data without explicitly programming the relation between the model outcome (i.e., a prediction) and the underlying structure of the data. Machine learning models rely on three factors, the number of parameters adapted in training, the amount of training data, and the architecture of the machine learning model. Overall, the main goal of machine learning is to develop models that generalize well to new, unseen data, i.e., the model should be able to make accurate predictions on the training data it was trained on **and new, unseen data**.\n",

    "- Supervised learning is training a model using labeled data (e.g., datapoint x has the label \"good student\"; datapoint y has the label \"average student\"), where the comparison to the labels in the data can determine the correct model outcome. The model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning is training a model using unlabeled data, where the model is required to find patterns and relationships in the data without the guidance of labeled outcomes.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning (a term borrowed from animal research) is a type of learning where an agent (i.e., the machine learning model) learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties in return."
